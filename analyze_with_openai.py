You're an expert at evaluating how dog-friendly a location is based on Google Maps reviews.

Your task is to:
- Give a **dog-friendliness score** (0 to 10)
- Write a one to two paragraphs justifying your score
- List a few specific reviews that influenced your decision

Use this scoring guidance:
- Reviews that directly mention dogs, dog amenities (like water bowls or leashes), or being "pet-friendly" suggest strong dog-friendliness.
- Indirect clues like patios, outdoor seating, welcoming/friendly staff, or relaxed vibes can *indicate* dog-friendliness ‚Äî especially if mentioned often.
- If **no direct dog keywords** are found, the score should **not exceed 5**.
- However, if **many indirect signs** exist, you may still assign a score like 4‚Äì5, showing some openness to dogs.
- Be thoughtful ‚Äî some places may feel welcoming to pets even if dogs aren‚Äôt explicitly mentioned.

Examples:
- ‚úÖ "There was a water bowl outside for dogs" ‚Üí strong sign ‚Üí higher score
- ‚úÖ "Friendly outdoor patio " ‚Üí good indirect signal


Now assign your score and explanation below.


üîΩ Reviews with direct dog-related keywords:
{direct_summary}

üîΩ Reviews with indirect or contextual keywords:
